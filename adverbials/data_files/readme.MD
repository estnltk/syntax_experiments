The file `entity_root_counts.csv` contains counts of lemmas of root words from OBL phrases in inessive in a random sample of approximately 1M sentences from koondkorpus. The idea was that OBL root words in inessive refer to locations and thus could be used to update the lists in TimeLocTagger but further analysis and cleaning is needed. The file `update_loc_lists.ipynb` was used to create this list.
The files `full_phrases_df.csv` and `full_phrases_in_df.csv` contain tables of verb+compound+obl_root+obl_form phrases obtained from a random sample of 50k sentences. The file `create_verb_adv_table.ipynb` in the folder `exploratory_files` was used to create it. The goal is to create a sample of verb+obl phrases where the obl phrase is a location/time. Currently these files include all phrases found from the sample sentences that follow the specified structure, further analysis is needed to extract specific time/location references.
