## Consistency between adverbial phrases and named entities

Adverbial phrases often coincide with geographical location or time expression, but not always. 
In these experiments, we study this problem in detail.
For that we use a stanza syntax analyzer to extract adverbials and dedicated taggers for isolating named entities and time expressions. 
After that we build a workflow for extracting sentences where these annaotations are in potential conflict and extract corresponding sentences for manual labelling.
