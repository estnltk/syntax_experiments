## Subcategorisation and argument structure

Statistical methods for extracting information about subcategorisation of verbs using only automatically generated syntax for a large text corpus. 
Subcategorization for verbs is defined by argument structure that specifies a list of selected arguments associated with specific lexical restrictions. 
For Estonian, these restrictions are defined in terms of plausible cases. 
It is imporant to note that not all arguments in the argument structure are mandatory and that the same verb can have more than one argument structure. 

Still it possible to use law of large numbers to extract important information about argument structure. For that, we tabulate syntax level collocations between verb phrases and noun phrases defined through obl dependency relation.
